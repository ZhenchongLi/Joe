# Feature Specification: Technical Blog Content Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ËøôÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂçöÂÆ¢ÁöÑÈ°πÁõÆÔºå‰ºöÊó•Â∏∏ÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÊäÄÊúØÁõ∏ÂÖ≥ÁöÑÂÜÖÂÆπÊõ¥Êñ∞Âà∞‰∫íËÅîÁΩë‰∏ä„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a blog author, I want to regularly publish technical content to the internet so that readers can access educational articles, tutorials, and technical insights. The content should be organized, easily discoverable, and presented in a readable format that encourages learning and engagement.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new technical article is written, **When** the author publishes it to the blog, **Then** it becomes available on the website with proper formatting and metadata
2. **Given** multiple technical articles exist, **When** a reader visits the blog, **Then** they can browse articles by categories (Thinking, Products, LeetCode, AI) and find relevant content
3. **Given** an article contains code examples or technical diagrams, **When** displayed on the website, **Then** the formatting preserves readability and technical accuracy
4. **Given** the blog has been updated with new content, **When** readers access the site, **Then** they see the latest articles and can navigate the content structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when article content contains special characters or formatting that could break the site layout?
- How does the system handle very long articles or articles with many images?
- What occurs if multiple articles are published simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow publishing technical articles with proper metadata (title, date, categories, tags)
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize content into predefined categories (Thinking, Products, LeetCode, AI)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display articles in a readable, responsive format across different devices
- **FR-004**: System MUST support code syntax highlighting and technical formatting
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate SEO-friendly URLs and metadata for better discoverability
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide navigation between articles and categories
- **FR-007**: System MUST support image optimization and proper display [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: image size limits and supported formats not specified]
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent visual design across all content pages
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow content updates and corrections [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: versioning or edit history requirements not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both Chinese and English content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: language switching or mixed-language handling not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Article**: Technical blog post with title, content, publication date, category, tags, and author information
- **Category**: Content grouping (Thinking, Products, LeetCode, AI) for organizing related articles
- **Media**: Images, diagrams, and other assets associated with articles
- **Metadata**: SEO and site information including descriptions, keywords, and social media previews
